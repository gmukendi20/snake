The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake on a grid. The goal is to eat food items, which makes the snake grow longer. The player must avoid crashing into the walls, obstacles, or the snake's own body. The game ends if the snake crashes. The objective is to achieve the highest score by eating as much food as possible.
